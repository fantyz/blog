Welcome to my very first blog post.<!--more--> While I'm really making this for me more than you, I do hope that it eventually turns out to actually be useful for more people than just myself. It would be cool if that could flip around some time in the future, but for now the primary goal is just to get started.

The very short introduction of me is that my name is Kasper. I am 42 years old. I have a degree in computer science from [DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/) and have spent all my professional life working with software development, architecture and leadership (or some combination hereof). I have worked in a lot of different domains (like gaming, logistics, security, fintech) as well in companies varying in size from a few people up to huge enterprises. Currently I work as a software engineer in a small successful startup.

I personally find writing, although it can be hugely time consuming, to be a really great way to work through all sorts of problems. The topics you potentially would encounter here in the future could range very broadly:

* Technical topics related developing software in general and more specifically working with Go, APIs and building cloud infrastructure.
* Business and leadership topics related how to best lead, organize and work within tech companies.
* Gaming related topics from the point of view of me being a passionate consumer of games.
* General life related topics about some of the major challenges that exist in my personal life.
* ...basically anything that is on my mind and substantial enough to write something meaningful about.

With that I'll move on to getting this blog properly setup and deployed.
